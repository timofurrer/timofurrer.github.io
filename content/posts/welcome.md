It's been a while since I discontinued my old blog with a staggering amount
of five posts. Let's see how it goes this time ...

This [page](https://tuxtimo.me) is a place I'll write about things I learned,
things I want to teach, things I'm working on and random thoughts.
I won't guarantee any cadance or consistency, but I'll try my best to keep
it around a few posts a month. To keep yourself updated with the content here,
you can follow me on [Twitter]({{< param social.twitter.url >}}) and add the
[RSS](/posts/index.xml) feed to your reader.

With that being said, have a good read and see you in one of the [posts](/posts) :tada:.
